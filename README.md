# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Hybrid-Neural-Network-Models-CNN-and-SVM-

This project aimed to develop an advanced hybrid model to enhance the accuracy of emotion detection from speech. Leveraging the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset—a benchmark dataset in emotion recognition—the model addresses challenges like noisy data, overlapping emotions, and subtle variations in emotional expression. To achieve this, the approach combines Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which effectively capture the perceptual and tonal qualities of human speech, with a hybrid architecture integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This hybrid design bridges the strengths of both methods, offering superior performance compared to traditional models like standalone SVMs or deep neural networks (DNNs).

The decision to use a hybrid CNN-SVM model stems from the unique advantages each component offers. CNNs are adept at extracting high-level spatial and temporal features from audio data represented as spectrograms or MFCCs. These features often reveal patterns crucial for differentiating between emotions. However, CNNs can sometimes struggle with overfitting, especially on smaller datasets like RAVDESS. By integrating SVMs as the classifier on top of the feature-rich embeddings generated by the CNN, the model gains robustness and better generalization to unseen data. This combination allows for the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to pair seamlessly with the SVM’s ability to define clear decision boundaries, resulting in more accurate classification of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

Extensive preprocessing was applied to ensure high-quality input data, including noise reduction and feature optimization of MFCCs. The model was designed to overcome key challenges, such as handling overlapping emotions and small dataset size, while minimizing overfitting. The hybrid architecture proved effective, achieving significantly improved accuracy over traditional emotion recognition methods.

The impact of this model extends to real-world applications in several fields. In customer service, it enables systems to detect and respond to emotional cues, creating more personalized user experiences. In mental health monitoring, it aids in identifying emotional changes, providing valuable insights for early intervention. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems also benefit from the model’s ability to adapt responses based on the caller’s emotional state, improving overall user satisfaction. By leveraging the strengths of a hybrid CNN-SVM architecture, this project demonstrates a significant advancement in emotion detection technology, showcasing its potential for transformative real-world applications.
